            <h1>State Budget of Victoria</h1>
            <h3>
                For any country's states and territories, government investment is crucial. 
                It sets the direction for growth and reflects the goals of the administration. 
                In Victoria Australia, these investments shape the state's future, touching areas from infrastructure and education to healthcare and public services. 
                This visualization provides a perspective on how the Victorian government uses its funds.

                    The geographical chart gives a visual picture of government investment between 2020 and 2023 in Victoria's regions. 
                    With the biggest spending overall over the years, 2020 stands out as a year of ambitious projects and initiatives. 
                    In contrast, regional spending decreased in 2021 and 2022, possibly signaling a period of consolidation or a change in priorities. 
                    By 2023, funding starts to go up noticeably in all regions, indicating increased commitment and perhaps a reaction to shifting demands or economic considerations.

                <p>
                    The heat map offers a graphic picture of investments made during a four-year period in Victoria's
                    regions. In 2021 and 2022, the majority of Victoria's outer regions—including Gippsland, 
                    the Grampians, and Hume—saw a lack of investment. The metropolitan areas received a lot of attention 
                    from the investments during this time. This may point to a deliberate effort to improve urban services 
                    and infrastructure, maybe in response to the demands and challenges of a growing urban population. 
                    A period of evaluation or realignment of priorities may be indicated by the lack of expenditures in the outlying regions, 
                    with a clear return to a more equal distribution by 2023.

                <p>
                    The Area and Line Charts shed light on how investments were distributed among key governmental sectors between 2015 and 2022. 
                    The persistent, considerable investment made in the transportation industry over time is a notable trend. Transport not only leads 
                    in terms of financial investment but also in terms of the volume of projects completed. This highlights the Victorian government's 
                    commitment to strengthening and maintaining its transportation system, maybe in an effort to improve connectivity, foster economic growth, 
                    and satisfy the needs of a burgeoning population.

                <p>
                    The Water sector, on the other hand, has seen the least investment, suggesting that either 
                    it hasn't been a top priority lately or that projects and infrastructure related to water have already received enough attention in previous years.

                <p>
                    A visual representation of the proportional investments in various government sectors for each year, from 2015 through 2022, is provided by the donut chart.
                    Each donut segment represents a particular sector, and the size of the section represents the proportion of the overall budget that segment will get.
                    The predominate investment in the transportation industry, which accounts for around 83% of the overall budget on average, has been a trend over the years. 
                    This significant allocation highlights the Victorian government's emphasis on connectivity and infrastructure. Other sectors with comparable smaller financial share include Culture,
                    Sport, and Community, Education and Training, and Health and Human Services. The focus on transportation implies that enhancing and growing the state's transportation networks is a primary priority.
